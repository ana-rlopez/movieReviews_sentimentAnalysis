Two ML models were checked for review classification: CNN and logistic regression. Their performance was assesed using accuracy rate.

Performance check on a validation set obtained from the training set:
Logistic Regression - Crossvalidation Accuracy: 0.8461% (+/- 0.0116%)
CNN - Validation accuracy: 0.8462 %

NOTE:
 * For logistic regression, the model is evaluated using crossvalidation (k-folding, with k=5)
 * In the case of CNN, to avoid computationally expensive computations, just plain split of the training set in two parts is used: 60% is   
used for training, while 40% of the training set is used for validation.           


Since their performance was similar, logistic regression model was selected, since CNN is computationally more expensive.

Performance check on the test set:
Logistic Regression - Test Accuracy: 0.8945%
